## COSC 3380 library simulation database website

### Setup:
- (optional) create a virtual environment
- make sure you're using python 3.11
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running:
- `python __init__.py`

It's that easy. Try connecting to the url to see what happens.

### System

Most files on the outside directory don't need to be touched. Each team member responsible for a set of pages should make their own module in `pages/`, following `example.py` to see how the framework works.

The system does not need any styling. Raw HTML is acceptable and desired. Javascript is also unlikely to be necessary at this stage unless you have a very good use case, as we only need to perform basic CRUD ops.
